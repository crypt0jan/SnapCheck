# checkSnap
Check if a phone number is linked to a SnapChat account.

## Usage
`python3 checkSnap.py -c <countrycode> -p <phonenumber>`

## Explanation
This script does nothing more than utilizing the `validate_phone_number` endpoint of Snapchat's API to tell you if a phone number is currently linked to a SnapChat account or not. No username or user ID is returned for obvious reasons.
